Thank you all for the valuable feedback! We have restructured the codebase to make it easier to use and contribute to.

NVIDIA Cosmos now includes three subprojects:

1. [Cosmos-Predict1](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict1) is a collection of general-purpose world foundation models for Physical AI that can be fine-tuned into customized world models for downstream applications.
2. [Cosmos-Transfer1](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1) is a world-to-world transfer model designed to bridge the perceptual divide between simulated and real-world environments.
3. [Cosmos-Reason1](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1) models understand the physical common sense and generate appropriate embodied decisions in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes.
