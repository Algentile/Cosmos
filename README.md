## GitHub project for NVIDIA Cosmos: https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos

NVIDIA Cosmos now includes three subprojects:

### Cosmos-Predict1: https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict1
- Cosmos-Predict1 is a collection of general-purpose world foundation models for Physical AI that can be fine-tuned into customized world models for downstream applications.

### Cosmos-Transfer1: https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1
- Cosmos-Transfer1 is a world-to-world transfer model designed to bridge the perceptual divide between simulated and real-world environments.

### Cosmos-Reason1: https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1
- Cosmos-Reason1 models can understand the physical common sense and generate appropriate embodied decisions in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes.
